# C-Sharp-File-Handler

An interm project for my summer 2020 internship to learn C#, providing some basic file handling functionality to add and read strings.

The aim was to familiarize myself with the basics of Object Orientated Programming for Windows using the C# Language and the Visual Studio IDE.
